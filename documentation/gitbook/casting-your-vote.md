# Casting Your Vote

Voting for active proposals in the Hypernet Protocol DAO is fascilitated by the open source Governance app hosted in the
Hypernet Foundation [launchpad](https://rinkeby.launchpad.hypernet.foundation). You must hold a non-zero amount of Hypertoken 
in your Ethereum account in order to participate, and each token counts as single vote. The steps for particpants are 
as follows:

1. Transfer Hypertoken into the account you wish to vote from.
2. Ensure you have enough Ethereum token to pay for network fees associated with transactions from this account. 
3. Delegate the voting power of the Hypertoken you hold to your account (you only ever have to do this once).
4. Select a proposal you wish to vote on that has an *active* status.
5. Cast your support for one of the three options (for, against, abstain).
