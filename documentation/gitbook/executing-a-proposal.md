# Executing a Successful Proposal

If a proposal is successful, it must then be executed by an externally owned account. Any account with sufficient Ethereum to cover the
network transaction fee can choose to execute the transaction on behalf of the DAO. Executing a proposal is a two-step process:

1. Queue the proposal and wait for the transaction to be mined. 
2. Execute the proposal.
