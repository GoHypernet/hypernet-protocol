# Hypernet Protocol Digital Payments

## Summary 

A successful payment protocol must solve problems on both sides of the market. On the consumer side, users expect a
payment solution that quickly executes transactions and is intuitive. To accomplish this, the Hypernet Protocol
integrates Connext's [Vector](https://github.com/connext/vector) library to enable fast, secure, microtransactions,
with minimal user intervention. On the merchant side, adopters expect a similarly refined onboarding process. The
Hypernet Protocol stack offers merchant developers a flexible platform that can adapt to the idiosyncratic requirements
of their particular business, and tools to streamline software integration. Meeting these needs has led to the development
light-weight developer abstraction layer. Developer's are isolated from the particulars of Layer 2 scaling protocols and
are presented with a small set of function calls bundled together in an npm package that looks familiar to those who
have used a traditional payment service provider SDK.
