# utils

This package contains a number of VERY useful utilities used throughout Hypernet Protocol and HyperPay. The utiliites include:

- ResultUtils for augmenting the Neverthrow library (to overcome bugs or typing shortcomings)
- AxiosAjaxUtils, a wrapper for the Axios ajax library that converts it to compatibility with Neverthrow.
- ChildProxy and ParentProxy: base classes for use with Postmate, that add an RPC-ish functionality on top.
- ValidationUtils: tools for validating user and API input, simplifying the native Ethers library.
