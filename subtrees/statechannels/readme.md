**statechannels** is a simple off-chain framework for building **state channel applications** on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to make it simpler to build permissionless applications that have instant finality with zero-fee transactions.

You can learn more about what state channels are by reading [one](https://l4.ventures/papers/statechannels.pdf) or [other](https://magmo.com/force-move-games.pdf) of the whitepapers underpinning the project, or a less technical written [description](https://medium.com/blockchannel/state-channel-for-dummies-part-2-2ffef52220eb).

### Installing dependencies

**Make sure you have Yarn v1.17.3 installed**. For easy management of specific Yarn versions, we recommend using [Yarn Version Manager (YVM)](https://github.com/tophat/yvm).

To install the dependencies:

```shell
yarn
```

from the monorepo root.

### Building packages

To build all packages:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Clean

To clean all packages:

```shell
yarn clean
```

### Lint

To lint all packages:

```shell
yarn lint:check
```

To also apply automatic fixes:

```shell
yarn lint:write
```

### Tests

To run all tests:

```shell
yarn test
```

### Publishing packages

All of the public packages in this repository are kept in lockstep. Use, e.g.

```shell
yarn lerna version minor
```

to increase the version in all of them (this works for the docs website, too), as well as pushing the version update to github.

Use

```shell
yarn lerna publish from-git
```

to publish the packages to npm (you will need to be logged in with `npm login`, and have your HEAD at the tagged commit -- so it's best to not commit between `version` and `publish`).

You may need to manually bump the version of devtools installed at the monorepo root to avoid installation problems.
