 * to `undefined`. In this case, merging the defaults {foo: {bar: 'baz'}} into {foo: undefined}
 * will result in {foo: {bar: 'baz'}}, but extending {foo: undefined} by the defaults
 * {foo: {bar: 'baz'}} will yield {foo: undefined}

 * a fixture factory that produces a fixture, given a set of default values

 *
 * Example
 * ```
 * const defaultState: StateWithHash = {...}
 * const stateWithHashFixture = fixture(defaultState, flow(overwriteOutcome, addHash))
 * ```
 * - If the consumer wishes to specify `outcome`, which is an array, they probably do not
 *   want to merge the provided outcome with the default outcome.
 *   Thus, we probably want to overwrite with the providedoutcome after constructing the object.
 * - If the consumer provided a state hash, it is probably incorrect, since the properties
 *   provided will be mixed with the default properties, which changes the state, yielding
 *   a different state hash
 *
 * Note that the consumer could specify `outcome` as an extend prop, but overwriting the outcome
 * is probably what the consumer expects, and doing it in the modifier serves as a convenience for
 * developers who wish to pass a single `mergeProps` object.
