# üåê Browser wallet

State channels wallet.

Currently, an application should run this wallet inside an iFrame and communicate with it via @statechannels/[iframe-channel-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statechannels/iframe-channel-provider) and [@statechannels/channel-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@statechannels/channel-client).

See https://docs.statechannels.org

### Why are webpack loaders in `dependencies`?

Currently the [`e2e-tests`](http://github.com/statechannels/apps/blob/master/packages/e2e-tests) package relies on `xstate-wallet` to run. Since we use environment variables as configuration options, and these are baked into the webpack builds at compile-time, we instead distribute the entire webpack dev server environment over `npm` to simplify things. We should move configuration options to be something declared at runtime.
